## Execution Instructions (assuming downloaded all files from this repo - as well as in console in the correct directory):

  1. Type 'python uspto_patent_parser.py' and hit enter (without the quotation marks).
  2. Type '1' and hit enter (w/out quotes)
  3. Enter the year, month and day as prompted
  4. The 'target document number' refers to the Appl. No. in the docx document. Enter ONLY the numbers.

The process will take a few minutes or so to run depending on network connection and computer.

To further improve, downloading files directly may be the best solution since the speed is decreased to seconds. In the works.
